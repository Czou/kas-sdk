	* Configurable codec profile: Group of pictures. 
	
	* Supports CIF video. Media core performs a frame rescale to modify video dimensions 
	from camera output format to CIF. This release does not support FRAME_SIZE parameter
	
	* Video bandwidth is limited depending on active network interface. kas-media allows a
	maximum bandwidth of 350 kbps for 3G connection and 1500 kbps for WiFi connection.
	
	* SDP negotiation does not support bandwidth negotiation.
	
	* Jitter adaptation buffer: KAS is designed for minimum latency and this decreases jitter
	tolerance. A low pass jitter adaptation filter has been implemented to optimize video
	continuity with minimun latency.
